Steps of setup
==============

How to
------
Just run setup.sh. This script will create the necessary symlinks in the SDK
directory.

Why
---
CoreKeeper requires the project to be embedded in their SDK. This terrible
design breaks the independence between projects and the API. To address this,
we use symlinks to isolate our project from their SDK.

This approach also simplifies SDK updates, as they recommend:
  Instead of trying to update your modding SDK, it is best to clone and set up
  a new one from scratch every time an update is released.
